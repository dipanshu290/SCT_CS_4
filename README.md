🔐 CyberForensic: Keystroke Logger & Threat Panel
CyberForensic is a glowing, desktop-based cybersecurity-themed keystroke logger and threat simulation interface. Styled like a retrofuturistic terminal, it mimics a forensic analyst’s toolkit and visualizes real-time typing behavior, flags risky input patterns, and generates simulated threat alerts — all inside a neon-lit dashboard.

Perfect for educational demos, UI prototypes, or experimenting with interactive typing data, this project runs entirely in-browser with no installation required.
